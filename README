jsocks-mirror
Pure Java SOCKS client and server mirrored from the sourceforge project 

Implements RFC1928 SOCKS protocol in both server and client form. Pure Java implementation that is easy to understand and easy to modify.

Some features:

   1. RFC1929 SOCKS 5 Auth
   2. SOCKS4 protocol
   3. Client code supports ATYP = 3 (DNS remote resolution).
   4. Full server implemenation. Its easy to create SOCKS servers that have custom authentication and firewall mechanisms. This is a great way to write custom VPN type software: 

This is a mirror from the JSOCKS sourceforge project. That project has had no updates since 2000. If I can get a hold of Kirill, I will delete this project. Google has made updates and is using this mirror to distribute our changes per the LGPL. Overall though, I hope we can continue to move this project forward.

Some changes Google has made:

    * Java style package names
    * Fixes to SOCKS client to support JDK 1.4 sockets concept of "connect()"
    * Log 4J logging instead of system.out.
    * Better logging statements through the ProxyServer class.
